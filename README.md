# Claude Proj Blueprint

A modular, level-based project template for teams building software with **Claude Code**, **Obsidian**, and **Figma**.

Pick your maturity level. Plug in your specs. Ship.

---

## Why

Every team reinvents project structure from scratch. This blueprint gives you an opinionated skeleton that scales from solo MVP to autonomous multi-agent systems — without locking you into a specific stack.

```
Level 1 → You and Claude as copilot on a weekend project
Level 4 → Agent teams with self-healing CI and compliance auditors
```

## Maturity Levels

| Level | What | Who it's for | What you get |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **L1** | ReAct loop | Solo devs, MVPs | `CLAUDE.md` + docs structure + Obsidian vault |
| **L2** | Planner + Executor | Small teams | + Skills (auto-invoked knowledge) + Slash commands |
| **L3** | Multi-agent with critique | Teams in production | + Hooks (automated gates) + Spec review pipeline |
| **L4** | Autonomous system | Mature teams | + Specialized agents + Agent teams + Self-healing |

Each level includes everything from the levels below it.

> **Where do these levels come from?** This framework is a practical synthesis — not invented from scratch. It combines industry frameworks, published research, and hands-on experience building with these tools. See [Influences & Attribution](#influences--attribution) for the full picture.

## Spec Modules

Specs are **plug-and-play** knowledge modules in `docs/specs/`. Enable only what your project needs.

| Module | What it covers | When to enable |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| `compliance/` | Laws, regulations, ISOs | Regulated data, certifications |
| `security/` | OWASP, access control, crypto | Every production project |
| `observability/` | Logs, metrics, traces, alerts | Every production project |
| `scalability/` | Caching, queues, performance | When scale matters |
| `versioning/` | API versions, migrations, semver | Public APIs, multiple clients |
| `design-system/` | Design tokens, component patterns, UI strategy | Projects with UI — makes Figma optional |
| `accessibility/` | WCAG, a11y | User-facing products |
| `i18n/` | Multi-language, localization | International products |
| `testing-strategy/` | Test pyramid, QA process | Teams with 3+ devs |
| `devops/` | CI/CD, IaC, environments | Every production project |
| `api/` | API conventions, endpoints, error format | Projects with APIs |
| `data-architecture/` | Modeling, pipelines, analytics | Data-intensive products |
| `ai-ml/` | Models, prompts, evals, guardrails | AI/ML products |
| `long-term-memory/` | Vector DB, semantic search | L4 autonomous systems |

### Adding a custom module

```bash
mkdir docs/specs/my-module
# Use any existing module as reference
# Optionally create .claude/skills/my-module/SKILL.md for auto-invocation
```

## The `[SPEC]` Convention

Every `[SPEC]` marker is an extension point. The blueprint tells you **where** things go; you fill in **what** goes there.

```markdown
## Tech Stack
[SPEC] List the actual project stack:
- Backend: [linguagem + framework]
```

Becomes:

```markdown
## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python + FastAPI
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
```

## How the 4 Layers Work

**L1 — CLAUDE.md** — Claude reads this automatically at every session. Your stack, architecture, conventions, gotchas. Keep it under 200 lines.

**L2 — Skills** — Markdown files that Claude loads based on natural language triggers. Say "write tests" and the testing skill activates. Say "debug this" and the debugger skill kicks in. 16 skills covering the full development lifecycle.

**L3 — Hooks** — Scripts that run before/after Claude uses tools. Lint on every file write. Security check before every bash command. Exit 0 = allow, exit 2 = block.

**L4 — Agents** — Sub-agents with their own context (security, compliance, quality, performance). Run individually or as a coordinated team with the author-critic loop.

**L4 — Agent Monitor** — Real-time observability for multi-agent sessions. Hooks emit structured JSONL events; two viewers consume them:

```bash
# Terminal dashboard (live, zero deps)
./scripts/agent-monitor.sh

# Web dashboard (visual graph + timeline)
python3 -m http.server 8080
# → http://localhost:8080/tools/agent-dashboard.html
```

**L4 — Memory** — Vector database indexes `docs/` and `src/` for semantic search. Ask "how did we handle rate limiting?" and get the relevant ADR, code, and PRD. Supports Chroma (local, default) or pgvector (shared, team-wide).

```bash
pip install -r memory/requirements.txt
python memory/index.py              # Index everything
python memory/query.py "auth"       # Semantic search
python memory/query.py --stats      # What's indexed
```

## Daily Workflow

```bash
cd your-project && claude

# L2+
# Shift+Tab+Tab → Plan Mode
# Describe feature intent
# Shift+Tab → Auto Accept
# /compact to compress context
# Commit frequently, new session per feature

# L2+ — Full lifecycle
# /ralph docs/product/feat-auth.md     → iterate until all criteria pass
# /debug "TypeError in auth module"     → systematic debugging
# /refactor src/auth/                   → safe structural refactoring
# /clean src/                           → remove AI slop from code
# /debt                                 → scan and prioritize tech debt
# Or just say: "don't stop", "debug this", "refactor", "clean up"

# L3+
# /spec-review src/ → run 4-agent audit (security + compliance + quality + performance)
# Magic keywords work: "security audit", "tech debt", "migration", "design API"

# L4+
# /memory search "how did we handle rate limiting"
# /learn --commits 20                   → extract patterns, improve skills
# "Create an agent team to implement auth with OAuth2"
```

## Integrations

**Obsidian** — Open `docs/` as a vault. PRDs, ADRs, specs are interconnected with `[[wiki-links]]`.

**Figma** (optional) — For teams with a designer. Add Figma links to PRDs, use the Figma MCP server for design-to-code. See the [Design Flow Guide](docs/design-flow-guide.md) to decide if you need it.

**Frontend Agent** (alternative to Figma) — For dev-only teams. Define design tokens in `docs/specs/design-system/`, choose a component library, and the `/implement` command generates UI from PRD requirements. No designer needed.

**GitHub** — Issue templates and CI workflow included.

## Influences & Attribution

The 4 maturity levels in this blueprint are a practical synthesis. They weren't invented in isolation — they combine industry frameworks, published research, and direct experience building products and technology with AI at the center.

### What's original

- The integration of **Obsidian + Claude Code + Figma Make** as a unified workflow
- The specific mapping of Claude Code features (CLAUDE.md, skills, hooks, agent teams) to maturity levels
- The `[SPEC]` convention and modular spec system
- The blueprint structure itself — opinionated on where things go, flexible on what goes there

### What came from the industry

| Source | What it contributed | How it shaped the blueprint |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Rushika Rai** — AI Agent vs Agentic AI framework | 5 technical maturity levels (Level 0→4) measuring what the agent can do alone | Inspired the level-based structure, but we reframed it: our levels measure how the *human* changes their way of working, not just the agent's capability |
| **OpenAI — Harness Engineering** | The concept that engineers should design environments, constraints, and feedback loops — not write code. AGENTS.md as a map to deeper docs. Architectural guardrails as agent multipliers | Directly influenced L3 (hooks as automated gates) and the CLAUDE.md → docs/ structure. Our Obsidian vault is the equivalent of their structured `docs/` directory |
| **DX Research — Q4/2025 Impact Report** | Data from 135k+ developers across 435 companies on AI adoption, time savings, and quality impact | Validated the progression: most teams are at L1 (copilot). Structured enablement is what moves teams forward, not just tool access |
| **Steven Choi** | Execution vs judgment distinction. Data showing Staff Engineers gain disproportionately more from AI agents. The "agentic context problem" warning | Reinforced why L3 and L4 exist: without governance and memory, L2 generates invisible tech debt at scale |
| **Anthropic — Claude Code architecture** | Skills, hooks, agent teams, CLAUDE.md convention, context compaction | The 4 levels map directly to Claude Code's feature progression: CLAUDE.md (L1) → skills + commands (L2) → hooks (L3) → agent teams + memory (L4) |
| **Mitchell Hashimoto** | The "harness" metaphor — every time an agent makes a mistake, engineer a solution so it never happens again | Shaped the L3 philosophy: hooks and gates aren't bureaucracy, they're compounding improvements |
| **Ruben Hassid** | Playbook for team adoption of Claude in 5 days using Projects and shared context | Informed how we think about L1→L2 transition for teams: adoption is an enablement problem, not a technology problem |

### The synthesis

The key insight that ties it all together: **most frameworks measure what AI can do. This one measures what humans need to change.** An autonomous agent (L4) without the right human governance is just a faster way to generate tech debt. The levels exist to ensure that as AI capability increases, human oversight and context-keeping scale with it.

This is a living framework. As tools evolve and the community contributes, the levels will too. If you've found patterns that should be here, open an issue or PR.
