# Learner

Analyze completed work and extract patterns to improve existing skills, suggest new ones,
and refine project conventions. This is a meta-skill: it makes other skills better.

## Rules

1. **Read-only analysis first** — understand patterns before suggesting changes
2. **Evidence-based** — every suggestion must reference specific commits, files, or patterns
3. **Conservative** — suggest changes, don't auto-apply. The human decides what to adopt
4. **Quality gate** — only suggest patterns that appear 3+ times (not one-offs)
5. **Output to docs** — write the report to `docs/architecture/learner-report-{date}.md`

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather data
1. Run `git log --oneline -N` (N from args, default 20) to see recent commits
2. Run `git log --stat -N` to see which files changed most
3. Read the diffs of significant commits: `git show --stat <sha>`
4. Read existing skills in `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`
5. Read existing commands in `.claude/commands/*.md`
6. Read `CLAUDE.md` for current conventions

### Phase 2: Analyze patterns
Look for:

#### A. Skill gaps
- Recurring manual steps that no skill covers
- Patterns Claude keeps explaining/doing that could be codified
- Workarounds or repeated code patterns across files

#### B. Skill improvements
- Skill rules that were violated in practice (maybe they're wrong)
- Skill checklists that are consistently skipped (maybe too strict)
- Skill triggers that didn't fire when they should have (description needs updating)
- Missing examples in skills that would have helped

#### C. Convention drift
- CLAUDE.md rules that don't match actual practice
- Commit message style drift from Conventional Commits
- File naming patterns that evolved beyond what CLAUDE.md documents

#### D. Hook gaps
- Errors that hooks should have caught but didn't
- Repetitive manual checks that could be automated
- New file types/patterns not covered by existing hooks

### Phase 3: Report
Write a structured report:

```markdown
# Learner Report — {date}

## Analyzed
- Commits: {N} (from {oldest_sha} to {newest_sha})
- Files changed: {count}
- Period: {date_range}

## Suggested new skills
### 1. [skill-name]
- **Pattern observed**: [what was done manually 3+ times]
- **Evidence**: commits {sha1}, {sha2}, {sha3}
- **Proposed trigger**: "[keywords]"
- **Proposed rules**: [list]

## Suggested skill improvements
### 1. [existing-skill-name]
- **Current rule**: [what the skill says]
- **Observed practice**: [what actually happened]
- **Suggestion**: [specific change]
- **Evidence**: [commits/files]

## Convention updates for CLAUDE.md
- [Specific addition or correction]

## Hook suggestions
- [New hook idea with trigger and behavior]
```

### Phase 4: Present
1. Summarize findings (not the full report — just counts and highlights)
2. Ask which suggestions to adopt
3. If approved, create/modify the relevant skills, CLAUDE.md, or hooks

## Phase 5: Conversation mining (optional, `--conversations N`)

Mine past Claude Code session transcripts for decisions, patterns, and insights
that weren't captured in commits or docs.

### How it works
1. Find recent session transcripts: `~/.claude/projects/{project-hash}/*.jsonl`
2. Read the last N transcripts (default: 5)
3. Extract from each:
   - **Decisions made** — architectural choices, trade-offs discussed
   - **Patterns repeated** — same type of question asked across sessions
   - **Errors encountered** — recurring issues that should be Gotchas
   - **Knowledge gaps** — things the agent didn't know that a human corrected
   - **Workarounds** — solutions that worked but should be formalized

### What to look for in transcripts

| Signal | What it means | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Human corrected the agent 3+ times on same topic | Missing convention or Gotcha | Add to CLAUDE.md Gotchas |
| Same file read in every session | Core context the agent always needs | Add to CLAUDE.md Module Map or context-engineering hierarchy |
| Agent asked "should I...?" repeatedly | Missing boundary in agent/skill | Add Always Do / Never Do rule |
| Workaround described but never formalized | Missing skill or runbook | Propose new skill or add to existing |
| Human shared external link for reference | Source-driven gap | Add to source-driven-development source table |

### Output
Append a `## Conversation insights` section to the learner report:

```markdown
## Conversation insights (from N sessions)

### Decisions not documented
- [Decision] — found in session {date}, not in any ADR
  - **Suggestion**: create ADR-{N} or add to CLAUDE.md

### Recurring corrections
- [Topic] — human corrected agent {count} times across {sessions} sessions
  - **Suggestion**: add Gotcha or skill rule

### Knowledge gaps
- [Gap] — agent didn't know [X], human provided [reference]
  - **Suggestion**: add to source-driven-development table or CLAUDE.md
```

## Configuration
- Analysis scope: [SPEC] `--since "2 weeks ago"` or `--commits 20`
- Conversation scope: `--conversations N` (default: 5 most recent transcripts)
- Minimum pattern frequency: 3 (to suggest as a skill)
- Output: `docs/architecture/learner-report-{date}.md`
