Implement a feature from a PRD.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS (PRD path, e.g. docs/product/feat-auth.md)

Workflow:
1. Read the PRD at $ARGUMENTS
2. Enter Plan Mode — create a detailed plan before coding
3. Check related ADRs in docs/architecture/
4. Check applicable specs in docs/specs/
5. **Detect design flow** (in priority order):
   - If `docs/design/<prd-slug>-PROMPT.md` exists OR PRD references a Claude Design handoff →
     activate `claude-design-handoff` skill: parse PROMPT.md, reconcile against CLAUDE.md + PRD,
     produce reconciliation report, resolve conflicts with user, then hand off to `frontend-agent`
   - Else if the PRD contains a Figma link → use Figma MCP to extract design context, then implement
   - Else → activate the `frontend-agent` skill:
     a. Load design tokens from docs/specs/design-system/README.md
     b. Scan existing UI components for consistency
     c. Generate UI from PRD requirements + tokens + component library
6. Implement following CLAUDE.md and the implement-prd skill
7. Create tests following the testing skill
8. **Documentation checklist** — before committing, verify and update:
   - [ ] CLAUDE.md module map (if new files/modules)
   - [ ] .env.example (if new environment variables)
   - [ ] README.md project structure (if new files/modules)
   - [ ] ADR in docs/architecture/ (if architectural decisions were made)
   - [ ] Gotchas in CLAUDE.md (if new edge cases discovered)
   - [ ] Notes in the PRD (if implementation revealed business insights)
   - [ ] Runbook in docs/runbooks/ (if new operational procedures needed)
   Skip items that don't apply, but actively check each one.
9. Commit with Conventional Commits format message

Always ask for plan confirmation before starting implementation.
